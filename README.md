# CCNA Study Guide – Full Repo

Welcome to your **CCNA Study Guide Repository**.  
This repo is designed as a structured, exam-focused knowledge base plus hands-on labs.

It’s organized around key CCNA topics, with deep dives on:

- NAT (Static, Dynamic, PAT, Port Forwarding)
- L2 Security (DHCP Snooping, Dynamic ARP Inspection, STP protections)
- WAN & VPNs (Fiber, SONET/SDH, DWDM, PPP, PPPoE, Internet connectivity models, MPLS VPNs)
- Converged Networks & QoS (policy, mechanisms, DiffServ, deployment)
- Modern topics: AI, ML, RAG, Cisco AIOps
- Labs (starting with NTP time sync)

- `02-Network-Access/` – Switches, VLANs, trunks, STP basics  
- `03-IP-Addressing-and-NAT/` – IPv4, subnetting, and all NAT flavors  
- `04-L2-Security-DHCP-ARP-STP/` – DHCP Snooping, Dynamic ARP Inspection, STP attack mitigation  
- `05-WAN-and-VPNs/` – Optical fiber, SONET/SDH, DWDM, PPP, PPPoE, WAN redundancy, VPNs, MPLS  
- `06-Converged-Networks-and-QoS/` – Converged traffic (voice/video/data) and QoS end-to-end  
- `07-AI-ML-and-RAG/` – Neural networks, LLMs, RAG, and AI/ML in network operations  
- `08-Labs-and-Config-Workbooks/` – Step-by-step config labs (NTP, etc.)

## How to Use This Repo

- Use it as a **study hub** for CCNA concepts.
- Treat each `.md` file like a mini-chapter.
- Open issues or add notes in your own fork to track weak areas.
- Add configs, packet tracer files, and screenshots as you lab.

You got this. 🚀
